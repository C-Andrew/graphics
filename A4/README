The final executable was compiled on this machine: gl04

My program does not have hierarchical modeling implemented.

How to invoke my program: ./rt


How to use my extra features: 
Super Sampling 
./rt nonhier.lua -ss
Please note that '-ss' flag must be the second paramter.


I have created the following data files, which are in the data directory:
These are to illustrate the implemented features.
(bb bounding box | SS super sampling)

My program assumes the following: Assumes you are running on machine gl04, or at least a machine with identical environment as gl04. 

I also assume that the lua files being passed in to ./rt are in the correct locations when running rt.
