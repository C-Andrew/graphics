Assignment: 5

The final executable was compiled on this machine: gl06

My program does not have hierarchical modeling implemented.

How to invoke my program: ./rt <filenam.lua> <-ss>


How to use my extra features: 
Super Sampling 
./rt nonhier.lua -ss
Please note that '-ss' flag must be the second paramter.


There are sample images in the data directory (/handin/A5/data/samples/) that exemplifies my objectives.
They are titled apprpriately to indicate which objectives they demonstrate.



My completed objectives are
- Cylinders and Cones as extra primitves
- Refractive Materials
- Reflective Materials
- Glossy Materials
- Texture Mapping to primitives
- Bump Mapping to primitives
- Adaptive anti-aliasing
- Depth of Field
- Animation

Extra Objective
- Multi-threading
- Animated final scene

Uncompleted bjectives are
- Constructive solid geometry





My program assumes the following: Assumes you are running on machine gl06, or at least a machine with identical environment as gl06. 

I also assume that the lua files being passed in to ./rt are in the correct locations when running rt.
